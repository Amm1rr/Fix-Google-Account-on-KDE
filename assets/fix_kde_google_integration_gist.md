## ðŸ›  What It Fixes

1. **"This browser or app is not secure" error**

   - **Cause**: The `fake-user-agent.patch` in the `signon-ui` package disrupts Googleâ€™s authentication.

2. **"This app is blocked" error**
   - Occurs when accessing Google Drive due to misconfigurations in KDE's settings.

The script updates your KDE configuration files and resolves both issues automatically.

## ðŸ“‹ Notes

- Tested on **Manjaro**, **Arch**, **KDE Neon**, **Fedora**, and **OpenSUSE**.
- Creates a backup of original files for safety.
- Reapplication may be needed after KDE updates.
